After having this website set up for more than a year, we figured it was about time we used it to organize all the information you all will need to know about the team and our game plans.

Legion Studios has grown beyond our previous workflow and has adopted a more professional one, which means that the content we deliver will most likely be significantly slower than before.

We're also taking the time to revisit and refine old models and textures to improve the overall experience of our mod.

Part of these increased quality standards is the consolidation of information, so you all can easily access our information and documentation in one easy-to-find place.

We hope you continue to work with us and give us your lovely feedback!~
